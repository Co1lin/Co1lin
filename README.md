### Hello, world! 🌏

Hi, I'm Colin. 👋

- 🎓 I'm an undergraduate majoring in [Computer Science and Technology (CST)](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) at [Tsinghua University (THU)](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
- 🔭 I love playing with computers and software.
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on research projects on the intersection of machine learning and systems, including providing system support for machine learning and optimizing computing systems with machine learning.
- 🌱 I enjoy learning about new stuff like economics, piano, skiing, etc., as it brings me maximum marginal happiness.

Compared with final exams, I prefer doing [Course Projects](https://github.com/Co1lin/Co1lin/blob/main/Course%20Projects.md).
