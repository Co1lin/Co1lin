### Hello, world! 🌏

Hi, I'm Colin. 👋

- 🎓 I'm a PhD student at [Columbia CS](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/). I was an undergraduate at [CST](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/)@[THU](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). 
- 👓 I'm luckily advised by Professors [Junfeng Yang](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/) and [Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/).
- 🔭 I'm working on the intersection between AI, SE and systems, in terms of reliability or efficiency.
- 🌱 I am also interested in social science topics including economics and game theory. I enjoy developing new skills as it brings me maximum marginal happiness.

**Co1lin/Co1lin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
